//! `--robot-history-timeout-ms` parity with Go v0.25.0 (issue #166).
//!
//! Go registers the flag as a pflag `flag.Int` defaulting to -1, meaning UNSET
//! (`cmd/bv/main.go:1549`), and spends it in exactly one place:
//! `handleRobotTriage` calls `generateTriageHistoryBounded`
//! (`robot_registry.go:2187-2189`), which wraps the git-history correlation
//! prologue — `correlator.GenerateReportCached` — and nothing else. Reading
//! the handler end to end matters here: `ComputeTriageWithOptionsAndTime`, which
//! consumes the report, is deliberately OUTSIDE the budget. Only the prologue is
//! bounded; triage scoring is not.
//!
//! Before this flag was wired, Rust hardcoded `history_status` to `"ok"`
//! whenever there was open work, so the flag changed nothing and the prologue
//! ran unbounded. The tests below drive the real binary against the workspace
//! (itself a git repository with a `.beads` file, so the prologue really runs)
//! and assert on the one field the budget is allowed to move:
//! `triage.meta.history_status`.
