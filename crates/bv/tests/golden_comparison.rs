//! Golden comparison gate — runs the Rust binary against each fixture with
//! every golden-captured command, normalizes nondeterministic fields
//! (timestamps/timings), and compares against the frozen Go goldens in
//! `golden/` byte-for-byte (modulo normalization).
//!
//! This is the real differential gate the CI "Golden corpus integrity" job
//! was waiting on. It operates as a RATCHET:
//!
//! - Infrastructure regressions (binary error, invalid JSON) always fail —
//!   those break the harness itself, not just parity.
//! - Content divergences fail only when the count exceeds
//!   `GOLDEN_GATE_BASELINE_FAILS`. Lower the constant as parity work lands;
//!   never raise it. When it reaches 0 the gate is a hard byte-for-byte
//!   contract.
//! - Goldens the corpus provably cannot decide are classified as corpus
//!   defects against a separate, equally-ratcheted bucket, and are reported by
//!   name. They are never dropped silently.
//!
//! Note: `selfrepo` goldens were captured against this live repo's
//! `.beads/issues.jsonl` and its live git history, both of which move
//! continuously as work lands. The two cases that read git HEAD are detected
//! and classified automatically (see [`Inapplicable::HeadDrift`]) rather than
//! being carried as an open-ended exemption.
